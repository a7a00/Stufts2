Oh, I've been waiting to make that joke.

There are 2 videos you NEED to watch on the website. Essentially, you need to be prepared to never master everything, and never succeed against attackers who have infinite time, motivation, and money. Fun, no?

Ming just asked us to name huge controversies and everyone talked about Hillary Clinton and Ashley Madison.

Here are the big ones:
* Restricting Information
* DDoS
* Hackers
* Governments
* 0-day
* Disclosure
* Encryption
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Vulnerabilities
* Access Points
* Access Control
* Social Engineering
* Advertising
* Malware
* Control
* Cyber-War
* Mobile devices
* Sanitization
* One-way functions
* Phishing
* Physical security
* IP and DRM

Regardless, this course is a little about a lot, and we need to keep our efforts well within scope.

God, Ming is an amazing speaker. Also we went through the Ashley Madison dumps.
