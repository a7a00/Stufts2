Instructions on running image_transform.py
python image_transform.py input_image output_image transform_function [n_v n_h]

(n_v is the number of vertical segments to run in different threads, n_h is the
number of horizontal cuts)

Instructions on running rockband.py
python rockband[1].py data_file.txt

(This code was built on OSX, and seemed to run well on the one Linux machine I
tested it on. If it behaves irregularly, please let me know!)
