Sorr for the shit notes today, I am *really* sick. WebMD says acute viral pharyngitis.

Basically what comes out of the first 20 minutes is that Darwinian orgamisms don't just help themselves, they help their families. Evolution doesn't neccessarily mean indicidual survival, and emotions are no exception. While some help us stay alive (fear), others help us protect others (compassion). Have a list of the most common phobias at Tufts for the hell of it.

* Spiders
* Snakes
* Heights
* Storms
* Large Animals
* Darkness
* Blood
* Strangers
* Humiliation
* Leaving Home Alone

Funnily enough, not too many people here are scared of the dentist.

The main takeaway from this lesson seems to be that all emotions have an adaptive purpose. THey draw attention to problems, keep attention on them until they're solve, and different emotions are adapted to solve different kinds of problems.
