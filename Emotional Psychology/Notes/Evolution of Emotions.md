# Evolution of Emotions

It's no secret that different organisms have very similar homology for expressing emotions. Baring teeth and narrowing eyes is a sign of anger seen in everyone from cats to people who want to Make America Great Againâ„¢.

Oh, and a reminder that your Emotion in Daily Life project starts this week. Do it or you're fired. (See above picture) 

So, first experiment! Watch [this](www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk) video!

Now, tell me how much you'd like to visit this place:

This'll be important later, but for now, let's look at:

## Main Perspectives on Emption

Clinical psychologists want to know how to extend beneficial moods and cut harmful ones. But affective scientists have different priorities:

* How are emotions generated?
* How does context affect our emotions?
* Are there any differences in emotional style?
* What is the relationship between various components of a response?

There are about 4 main perspectives on emotion.

### Jamesian

William James had the basic position that emotion are the perception of bodily changes in response to outward events. What we call "emotions" are simply the subjective feelings those changes demonstrate. So, according to James, when I watch MLP, I undergo physiological changes as a result of excitement and percieve the changes as "feeling happy".

This perspective has its issues. Aside from the ides of watching MLP causing changes in someone being creepy as all hell, there's no real place that the universal "happy" expression came from. There's also no reason why those same changes can often manifest as anxiety. Essentially, this is a hash-collision that this theory can't effectively resolve.

Also, according to this theory, smiling for a while should make us happy. (If only that worked...)

James believed that emotions are adaptive; they have unique survival value. The way your body reacts causes you to experience the target emotion, and the behaviors that help you survive live on, along witht he emotion attached.

### Cognitive

From this perpective, thoughts and emotions are inseperable. Emotions are a function of the thoughts we have, specifically thoughts known as *appraisal*, the process by which events are judged as good or bad. A good example of this view in action is 2-factor theory. When something happens, your brain slaps a cognitive label on it. It then combines that label with the physiological changes that happened, and generates the emotion from the 2, which explains why it's so easy to switch back and forth between excitement and anxiety.

Some cognitive theories propose that discrete emotions are elicited by a unique combination of a few simple, 1-bit "master appraisals"

* Is is new?
* Is it pleasant?
* Can I control it?
* Can I predict it?
* Did I cause it?

These all combine to form a label. So, for example, the appraisals above being:

* Unpleasant
* Not caused by you
* Easy to predict

should cause anger. This is why narrative-spinning is so useful. Simply changing the narrative so even one of these appraisals has the opposite answer can completly change the label, and thus the emotion. Since these appraisals happen under the hood, it's very easy to do unnoticed.

### Social Constructivist

This theory posits that emotions are simply products of a culture, and thus owe their meanings to social rules we learn as we grow up. A favorite of Marxists, and their descendants, SJW's.

The theory says that emotions are not innate; they simply reflect a moral judgement of how society *thinks* you should feel. Emotions are therefore constructed by society to serve social functions. So, for example, anger is elicited when you feel you've been wronged by another person, which is hugely important. Anger then becomes a deterrent to harm other people around us. There's also an idea in some cultures that extreme anger causes you to do things you'll later regret. This is important because it encourages us to seek atonement and forgive others.

Our social justice buddies love this explanation, because it holds water scientifically, but can be significantly twisted to excuse their shitty behavior. You shouldn't be repulsed or angry when they bully you; the evil boogeyman of the week has brainwashed you into thinking that! Friendly reminder that this is a perversion of the original theory. If society has conditioned you to hate bullies, there's a pretty damn good reason. Just because something's a social construct doesn't mean it isn't real.

### Darwininan

This theory is based off Darwin's theory of evolution, (no...) and says that emotions are vestigial, derived from habits that had once been useful to our ancestors, but have no real use in civilized society. They serve as signs of what may either be defunt survival functions, or potentially a communicative function that we still use today.

This theory is supported by the idea that we should see the same emotions in all people everywhere and by extension in all related species.

Evolutionary Psych is a branch of psych that believes in Darwin's idea that every mentalcapacity is gradually acquired from generation to generation. All behavior is a function of psychological adaptations that recieve input. This would also explain why the romantic emotions kick hardest; they're directly related to life's prime directive, HAVE BABIES. All these psychological adaptations, at some basic level originate from evolutionary processes, specifically selection of advanageous traits. These adaptations can be thought of as devices that process information. There are inputs, adaptive problems posed to you, and these devices decide on the best approach to solve them. These mechanisms are instantiated in our neural networks, and as a result are physically copied from one gereration to the next.

All of this evolution distills down to emotions that make us ambitious, eager to succeed, and willing to use both our advantages of genes and birth to get ahead.

I was going to put Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein there, but he works, too.
