# Intro to EmoPsych

All, right, first class, let's do this! Campus seems normal apart from:

* Memorial steps have been dynamited
* CS now largest major
* Too many freshmen (athough I'm in a psych class, should be expected, we accidentally overaccepted by 200)
* Donald Trump is now a thing and people are protesting him, which is hilarious

I'm off to a great start by eating Kimchi Jjigae last night and leftover Ä‡evapi this morning, so aside from being in intestinal agony, I think I'm ready to do this shit! Let's go!

Haven't felt this much Korean pain since that history lecture last year!

## Intro

The course seems interesting, our professor is an electrophysiologist studying emotional regulation, and our TA is a Croatian grad student studying emotional inhibition.

Let's start broadly, most current events throughout history have evolved emotion fairly high up in the chain. Also, we're going to be discussing current events in this class, oh boy.

Now we're being asked to pick emoji that match a situation we're in. Turns out we share common symptoms.

This class in an indtroduction to emotional theory and research, witha basis in either Psych 101 or Cognitive. We'll be working on the nature and regulation of emotion, yet it'll have enough societal stuff to count as a social science requirement, which is actually pretty nice.

The course will have 3 noncumulative exams, just like Cognitive did, with the addition of two reaction papers, whatever those are. Also, there's a final project. Unfortunatley, I can't cop out of that by going to the psych building and filling out surveys.

## Exams

Exams are both multiple choice and short answer, study guides will be posted as a courtey one week in advance. They will be given:

* Tuesday, Oct. 6
* Tuesday, Nov. 3
* Thursday, Dec. 3

## Reaction Papers

Literally what you did in freshman year of BxSci. Read a journal article and link it to your own experience. Whoo. 1 page single spaced.

On the bright side, the one you do better on will be weighted as 75% of your final research grade, which is nice.

## Final Project

Details to come. Due date will be December 17.

## Extra Credit

You can earn a staggering 1% extra credit! Basically, show up to class and participate and you'll get them thrown at you.

As a side note, do not use email to ask course questions, go to office hours. Email is active during business hours.
