## Cultural Perception of Emption (Pt. 2)

Cultural environment can dramatically effect perceptions of emotion. For example, if we ask US and Japanese people to report their experiences of socially engaging and disengaging emotions, we find that the Japanese report positively engaging emotions more than us, while we report more positive disengaging emotion. And it works the same way with negative emotions, too.

Culture also influences the extent to which we express our emotions, even if we experience them. For example, the Japanese express more positive and fewer negative emotions. And even in America, Asians mask their experience more than whites.

This idea revolves around the fact that culture is a system for regulating social interaction, promoting norms for how emotions are regulated. Emotional situations happen in everyday life, but in many situations, they're inappropriate, so we temper our responses. Besically, we treat emotional responses as events that we then respond to with their own reactions.
