# Commuication of Emotion

So, there are 5 kinds of nonverbal communication, (which you need to WRITE DOWN, genius) but this lesson focuses manly on how we choose to display emotions.

Buhler's theory tells us that emotions are expressions of our internal states (the "push" function) and are used as a signal to produce reactions from others (the "pull" function) They can also serve a symbolic function, where the expression represent the nature of the emotion producing event.

It should be fairly easy to tell when an expression is fake, even animation with fairly few details can convey it.

There are a few key signals you can watch for that DHX knew about:

* Real markers of emotion last about 10 seconds. Fake ones are much longer or much shorter.
* Real expressions involve involuntary muscle action. The most common one is involuntary movement of the eye muscles that accompany a smile.
* Real displays have parallels in other species.
* Real ones are less large than we *think* they are. That's why smiles that show a lot of teeth are usually fake, if not completley menacing.

Our friend Darwin wrote a book called "On the Expression of Emotion" where he outlined:

* The Principle of Servicable Habits - Emotions that serve a purpouse will continue to be expressed.
* The Principle of Antithesis - Any emotional expression has a bodily opposite.
* The principle of Nervous Discharge - Get your head out of the gutter, it's not that. It's the idea that excess engergy will manifest itself as random expressions.

This book gave rise to 2 mutually supportive hypotheses, an *encoding hypothesis*, that the same distinct emotion should be displayed by everyone everywhere, and the *decoding hypothesis*, that everyone everywhere should interpret distinct emotions the same way.

There are 7 "main" universal expressions, but of course some don't fit, and that leads to 3 main criticisms:

* The same expression can have very different meanings in different contexts.
* Expressions used in the studies are often fake.
* People in studies often game the questionnaire system.

In response, the universality people respond that spontaneous emotion is also expressed similarly across cultures.

The current theories of expression agree that emotion may be a universal lnguage, but has several different "dialects". People in different cultures have different emotional "accents". So, while it's *technically* the same language, it can be damn tricky to understand, even if the expressions are similar.
